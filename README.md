# hello-world
practice repository:
I am a research coordinator for the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center and a part-time MPH student but most of my experience is in basic science research. I enjoy going to concerts, traveling, building things, and learning German in my spare time. I'm a NJ transplant living in Cleveland, OH with my husband. I can't wait to learn more about coding and statistics!
